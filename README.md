## System Overview:

<p align="justify">
This document outlines the development of a comprehensive product management system, integrating a <code>Spring Boot</code> backend with a <code>ReactJS</code> frontend. The system is designed to facilitate the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of product data, providing a robust solution for managing product inventories. The backend component, developed using <code>Java Spring</code>, establishes a <code>RESTful</code> API to handle data operations, while the frontend, built with <code>ReactJS</code>, offers a dynamic user interface for interacting with the API. The system leverages a <code>MySQL</code> database for persistent data storage, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The <code>Spring Boot</code> backend is structured to include a repository layer, utilizing <code>CrudRepository</code> for database interactions, and a service layer to implement business logic and data validation. Controllers are implemented to define <code>RESTful</code> endpoints, supporting <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> requests. The system addresses Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend. The <code>ReactJS</code> frontend is designed with reusable components for forms and tables, employing <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks to manage component state and lifecycle. The frontend interacts with the backend API using the <code>fetch</code> API, enabling asynchronous data retrieval and manipulation.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The development of this system emphasizes modularity and maintainability. The <code>Spring Boot</code> backend utilizes dependency injection and annotations such as <code>@RestController</code>, <code>@GetMapping</code>, <code>@PostMapping</code>, <code>@PutMapping</code>, and <code>@DeleteMapping</code> to define API endpoints and manage request mappings. The <code>ReactJS</code> frontend leverages component-based architecture and state management to provide a responsive user experience. The integration of <code>Bootstrap</code> enhances the user interface with consistent styling. The system is designed to support efficient data management, providing a foundation for scalable product inventory solutions.
